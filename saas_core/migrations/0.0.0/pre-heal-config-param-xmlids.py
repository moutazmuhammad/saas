"""Heal config params that exist by key but lost their ir.model.data xmlid.

When a config parameter declared in data/ir_config_parameter.xml exists
in the DB WITHOUT its ``saas_core.config_param_*`` xmlid, the ``noupdate``
data loader can't find the xmlid, tries to CREATE the row, and hits
``ir_config_parameter_key_uniq`` — the upgrade crashes (observed twice on
odoo.odex.sa with saas_master.max_instances_per_user).

The orphaning can recur at ANY time, not just once: deleting a parameter
from Settings > Technical > Parameters removes its xmlid with it, and the
next Settings save (``set_param``) recreates the row bare. A one-shot
version-pinned migration (this script's first life, at 18.0.26.0.0) only
heals DBs upgrading *across* that version — which is why the crash came
back. Living in ``migrations/0.0.0/`` it runs as a ``pre`` script on
EVERY version change, just before data/ir_config_parameter.xml loads.

Healing = backfill the missing xmlid (never delete the row), so the
operator's configured value is preserved and the loader skips creation.
A dangling xmlid (pointing at a deleted row while a live row holds the
key) is re-pointed at the live row for the same reason.

Only the params actually declared in data/ir_config_parameter.xml are
healed — creating an xmlid for anything else would make end-of-upgrade
orphan cleanup delete that param along with its value. KEEP THE LIST
BELOW IN SYNC WITH THE DATA FILE.
